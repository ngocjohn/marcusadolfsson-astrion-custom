/**
 * Thermostat card, shaped after the ecobee app's own.
 *
 * Current temperature large on the left, setpoint in an outlined pill on the
 * right — with "Holding" and a clear button inside that pill when the thermostat
 * is off its schedule. Tapping the pill opens a scrolling temperature picker;
 * tapping outside closes it.
 *
 * ONE ROW, not stacked. The stacked version matched the phone app but the phone
 * app gets a whole screen per thermostat; here the card shares a scrolling page
 * with lights, shades, the bed and a fan, and 100dp of mostly-empty card pushed
 * everything else below the fold. Side by side keeps both numbers legible in
 * about half the height.
 *
 * THE ROOM NAME IS GONE on purpose: every card sits under a `separator` naming
 * its section, and the page itself is the room.
 *
 * Setpoint changes live behind the picker rather than as − / + on the face. On a
 * 3" screen those circles were the biggest touch targets on the card, so the most
 * destructive action was also the easiest to hit while scrolling past.
 *
 * Config:
 *   { "type": "bubble_climate", "options": {
 *       "entity_id": "climate.living_room", "step": 1,
 *       "hold_entity": "binary_sensor.living_room_holding",
 *       "clear_hold": { "service": "button.press",
 *                       "entity_id": "button.living_room_clear_hold" } } }

     * The picker: mode, which setpoint is being edited, and a scrolling wheel.

     * THE AUTO CASE IS WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A WHEEL. In heat_cool a thermostat
     * has no single setpoint -- it has a low and a high -- so "set the
     * temperature" is an ambiguous instruction until you say which end. The
     * Heat/Cool toggle appears only in that mode, and only then, because in cool
     * or heat it would be a control with one possible answer.
     *
     * The commit is driven by SETTLING, not by every frame: a fling across
     * fifteen degrees would otherwise fire fifteen service calls at the
     * thermostat. `snapshotFlow` on "is it still scrolling" collapses a whole
     * gesture into the single value it came to rest on.
