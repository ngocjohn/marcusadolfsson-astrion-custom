/**
 * Media player card with two layouts:
 *  - "compact" (default): a single row — round album art, title/artist, and
 *    prev / play-pause / next / vol- / vol+ controls. Blurred art background.
 *  - "full": a big square album art on top, title/artist, then transport and
 *    volume rows. For the dedicated Media page.
 *
 * Album art is loaded from the entity's `entity_picture` (auth'd fetch). Since
 * Modifier.blur is a no-op on this API 26 device, the blurred background is a
 * heavily downscaled copy upscaled to fill the card.
 *
 * Config:
 *   { "type": "media_player", "options": { "entity_id": "media_player.club",
 *       "variant": "full" } }   // omit variant for compact
 */
/**
 * Process-wide album art cache, keyed on `entity_picture`.
 *
 * The art used to live only in the card's `remember`, which is discarded the
 * moment the card leaves composition -- so every return to the dock index
 * re-fetched the poster over the network and re-ran the downscale, and you
 * watched it arrive. Nothing was wrong with the fetch; the result simply had
 * nowhere to survive.
 *
 * Both halves are cached. The downscaled copy matters as much as the original:
 * it is a filtered scale of a full-size poster, and redoing it on every swipe
 * is work this device has no headroom for.
 *
 * Bounded and access-ordered (a real LRU) rather than a plain map. A poster at
 * full size is a couple of MB, the key changes whenever the artwork does, and an
 * unbounded map would grow for as long as the app runs -- which on a remote that
 * is never restarted means forever. Four is enough for what you actually swipe
 * between; the blurred copies are 32px wide and cost nothing.
